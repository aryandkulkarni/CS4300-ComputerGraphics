Debugging

Edit the following lines to list two things you learned about debugging (a command, a technique, a concept. etc.). This is a "for-credit" exercise, I will not evaluate what I consider "difficult enough", I just want to know you learned or practiced two things about debugging.

1. I learned the technique of using bt, the backtrace command in gdb allowing me to view an entire call stack
   and see the function calls that were made before a bug.
2. I learned about different methods of tracking variables while debugging with gdb, including the watch command
   allowing me to subscribe to a variable and break upon a change, as well as manually being able to display the
   value with the display command.
