# Why am I not using Make?
# 1.)   I want total control over the system. 
#       Occasionally I want to have some logic
#       in my compilation process (like searching for missing files).
# 2.)   Realistically our projects are 'small' enough 
#       this will not matter.
# 3.)   Feel free to implement your own make files or autogenerate it from this
#       script
# 4.)   It is handy to know Python
